At the core, I remain the person I was before, which until very recently included driving the SAME car, now almost 12 years old, complete with dents and duct tape patching. But playing Survivor fueled parts of me that were always there, maybe untapped, or maybe pushed me to honor those parts. It\'s made me more open to life experiences in general, fueled the desire to travel, and now plays a huge part in our family motto of #GoSeeDo (go places we don\'t normally get to go, see people we don\'t normally get to see, do things we wouldn\'t normally do).

I played three seasons when I was in my 20s and then processed my experiences for the last decade.
